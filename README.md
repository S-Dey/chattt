### Using

```sh
> npm install -g chattt

> chattt
```


### Basics

When `chattt` opens, you are asked the channel name that you want to join. Enter the name, and then enter your desired handle as well.

If everything goes well, you should be going the channel.

The working of this application is IRC inspired so you will see messages when users join or leave a channel.
